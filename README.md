# Slide Toaster

This helps to toast some tasty and beautiful slide.
It uses [Toast UI](https://ui.toast.com/tui-editor), and [Marpit](https://marpit.marp.app/) on top of [NuxtJS](https://nuxtjs.org/).

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
